# Mess-Assistant

A dialogue system which provides an interface to the [IIIT Mess Portal](https://mess.iiit.ac.in/). Check your mess registration and menus, change your mess registration, and cancel and uncancel your mess registrations using the dialogue system. This was originally made as my CL-2 project and is now open-source.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Docker - [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Running the Dialogue System Locally

- Launch the required docker containers using the following command.
```bash
docker compose up
```
- The web interface for the dialogue system can be accessed at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
